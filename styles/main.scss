/* 
 * This is the main scss file that will include all other files and generate css.
 * 
 * 1. If You want your stylesheet to be name differently, rename this file.
 * 2. If You feel that any section grew to long, move it into separate file,
 *    just the same as modules.
 * 3. Please do not modify the order of sections, as this will result in unexpected
 *    output if in any output at all.
 * 4. Use --style=compressed (or similar format) to get compressed output for production.
 * 5. Visit http://sass-lang.co/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#output_style1
 *    for more information about compressing output.
 * 6. Use --sourcemap=none (or similar format) to avoid generating map for production.

 * -------------
 * If Your application uses any of vendor supplied styles, start building css
 * with them, so they can be easily overwritten by custom styling. */

/* Theme settings 
 * --------------
 * Import settings for the current theme - mainly colors, but anything specific
 * to the style can go there. If You plan to build more themes, copy this file, 
 * rename accordingly to the theme name and change this line. */

 * -------------
 * Setup Your helpers that will have defaults set from the theme settings. */

 * -------------------
